A removable cup holder for the Renault Twizy


# Renault Twizy Cup Holder
## Overview
This project provides a removable cup holder and box for the Renault Twizy.  The holder is designed to fit to the side of the driver's chair and can be used on either side or both sides at once as required.  The holders are removable to enable them to be stored if a passenger needs the space around the driver's seat.

This project is open-source.  You can find the OpenSCAD source here: https://github.com/simoninns/Renault-Twizy-Cup-Holder

## Printing instructions
The model has been printed and tested on the Prusa MK3S/MMU2S printer using Prusament PETG filament. All parts fit on a 20x20 printing bed.

### Recommended print settings

Print settings (for Prusa Slicer) are the same for all included parts:

* Material: PETG
* Layer: 0.30mm
* Infill: 25%
* Supports: No Supports

# Assembly
Simply slot the cup holder or box into the holder; it will 'click' into place.

The holder should be attached to the seat with thin double-sided tape (make sure it is heavy-duty tape and clean the plastic surfaces before attaching).

See the included images for more details.
